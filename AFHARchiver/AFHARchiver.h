/**
 `AFHARchiver` is a class for creating an HTTP Archive (HAR) file that can be used for logging information around specific requests. This class will listen for 'AFHTTPRequestOperations' to complete, and log them directly to disk.
 
 ## HTTP Archive
 
 The HTTP Archive Specification ( http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/ ) outlines how an HTTP request can be archived for viewing. This specification is supported by most HTTP request viewers available today.
 
 There is a online viewer located at http://www.softwareishard.com/har/viewer/ that allows developers to drop HAR files directly into the page and view all of the archived information.
 
 The archiver will asynchronously archive data to disk as operations complete.

 @discussion This method can be used to prevent certain operations from being logged. For example, you may only want to log specific API requests, so this block can be used to inspect the operation, and determine if it should be logged. A more common use would be to inspect and see if the operation is an 'AFImageRequestOperation', and choose not to log it. This can save a significant amount of disk space.
